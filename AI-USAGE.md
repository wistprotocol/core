# AI Usage

This file records the generative-AI involvement in this repository's
history from before per-commit provenance marking existed — every commit
up to and including the one introducing this file. From that point on,
commits with substantially AI-generated content name the model used in
an `Assisted-by:` git trailer.

## Record

Development in the covered period used Claude Fable 5
(`claude-fable-5`, Anthropic) via Claude Code, under human direction:
maintainers directed the work and reviewed and accepted every change
before it entered history. Delegated subagent tasks may have executed
on other Claude-family models (Claude Opus, Claude Sonnet) under
Fable 5's direction and final review, so provenance is recorded at the
orchestrator level.

AI-drafted: the Rust implementation of the WIST-1..4 primitives, its
tests, and documentation.

Human: the architecture and API shape, the cross-repo engineering
decisions this crate follows, and the review and acceptance of every
change. Conformance is defined outside this repository, by the WIST
spec repository's schemas and test vectors (`tests/conformance.rs`);
when implementation and spec disagree, the spec wins.
